# SuperTrunfo-C
Novice challenger super trunfo -  C 

Hey guys, how are you?!

My name is Natanael Sebastião and this is the first step on C! 
Super Trunfo is a card game, so i decided to create a card game based on Super Trunfo but with cities! 
This project is special because i learn soo mutch about the C, variables, functions, data output and input and even clearing the buffer XD!

The challenges on Novice project is - 

Create a program in C that allows the user to input data for two Super Trumps cards. For each card, the user must provide the following information:
State: A letter from 'A' to 'H' (representing one of eight states).

Card Code: The state letter followed by a number from 01 to 04 (e.g., A01, B03). Type: char[] (an array of characters, or string)

City Name: The name of the city. 

Population: The number of inhabitants of the city. 

Area (in km²): The area of the city in square kilometers. 

GDP: The Gross Domestic Product of the city. 

Number of Tourist Attractions: The number of tourist attractions in the city.

After the user inputs the data for each card, your program should display the registered information on the screen in an organized and readable manner. For each card, print each piece of information on a separate line, with a clear description.

*Functional Requirements

The program must correctly read the data for two cards from the user via standard input (keyboard).

The program must store the read data in appropriate variables.

The program must display the data for each card on the screen, formatted in a clear and organized manner, as shown in the example above.

Non-Functional Requirements

Usability: The program must be easy to use, with clear instructions for the user.

Readability: The code must be well-indented, with explanatory comments and meaningful variable names, making it easy to read and understand.

Correctness: The program must work correctly, without compilation or runtime errors.

Simplifications for the Challenge

You only need to implement the registration and display of two cards.

At this level, focus solely on reading, storing, and displaying the information. You do not need to implement any logic for comparing the cards or any additional features.

Do not use loops (such as for or while) or decision structures (such as if or else). Your code should be a simple sequence of instructions.

Bye!
